- run.py 				: loads pretrained model, applies on testing set and saves predictions in folder "testing_results", and also generates the submission file
- proj2_baseline.py 	: runs an RF classifier on features, either 2d(mean and variance) or 65d(extracted features), 5-fold cross validation
- proj2_unet.py			: trains a Unet CNN network and saves the weights
- classifier.py 		: auxiliary file with functions connected to the classification task
- keras_imports.py 		: auxiliary file with necessary imports connected to the keras framework
- helpers_reduced.py 	: auxiliary file with functions that are needed to run some of the scripts
- helpers.py 			: auxiliary file with functions that are needed to run some of the scripts

- unet_weights.hdf5 	: HDF5 file with the trained weights for the unet network
- features.npy			: numpy matrix of superpixel feature vectors for all the images
- labels.npy			: numpy array with label for each superpixel feature vector

The training and testing data folders, uncompressed, are in the same directory as the above files
The CNN is written on the keras framework, that runs on top of theano
